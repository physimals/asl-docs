BASIL toolset
=============

BASIL is a collection of tools that aid in the creation of quantitative 
CBF images from ASL data. It is available within `FSL <https://fsl.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl/fslwiki>`_ 
(v6.0.1 or later is strongly recommended). 

BASIL includes complete high-level pipelines for
processing ASL data and also individual tools for more bespoke analysis.

If you employ BASIL in your research please reference the article below, plus any others

If you employ spatial regularisation (priors) you should ideally reference this article too:

If you fit the macrovascular (arterial) contribution you should reference this article too.

If you employ the partial volume correction method then you should reference this article too.

If you perform model-based analysis of QUASAR ASL data then you should
reference this article too.
